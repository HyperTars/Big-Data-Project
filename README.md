# Impact-of-COVID-19-on-Financial-Market

## Project Description
- Our project will focus on several economic indicators which should be considered and by how much the COVID-19 has affected the world’s economy. We will work on the problem: What economic indicators should be considered with the effect of COVID-19?. To be more specific, we will gather a wide range of economic indicators, analyze each indicator’s characteristics and its correlation with COVID-19, then make comparisons to find out those indicators which are most sensitive to COVID-19. We plan to analyze indicators including:
  - Stock market, which involves several indexes and each NASDAQ stock’s historical pricing data
  - Commodities market, which involves metals, energies, grains, meats and softs
  - Cryptocurrencies market
  - Currencies market, or specifically, the exchange rate market
- Since each indicator may vary from others, we expect to witness significant differences between each of them. For example, the stock markets are quite sensitive to the COVID-19 progress and fluctuate rapidly, while the exchange rate market may respond to the COVID-19 slower and remain nonvolatile. These differences will help us better figure out all indicators’ features and by how much they have been impacted by COVID-19.

## Setup Instruction
- Raw company history data in `raw_stock_history_0421.zip`, we only keep a zipped file in git because they are too large, you can extract to your local disk before using. These stock data should be extracted and placed in a folder call 'stock-history' (should also be created manually) under `../clean_data/`. 

- Other raw data from `raw_data_0422.zip` is already extracted to data/ folder.

- Our source codes reside in `src/` folder. To start, please enter the folder via the command: `cd src/`

### Data Cleaning
- To clean data, run `CleanData.py`, the results will be saved in `../clean_data/`. To have a better understanding of what we do in this part, you can optionally run `CleanData.ipynb` to observe the better visualized version of cleaning code.
